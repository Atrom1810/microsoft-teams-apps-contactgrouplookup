 Contact Group (sometimes referred to as a distribution list) is very useful for organizations to manage communication with a group of individuals. Examples of contact groups include members of an emergency response team at a hospital, employees who work in a particular building, or employees who share a common hobby.
The Contact Group Lookup app makes it easier to interact with members of a contact group directly from Microsoft Teams. Using the app, you can quickly view and chat with members, see their status on Teams, and even start a group chat with multiple members of the Contact Group.

An example workflow in the app is described below:
 - A user starts by opening the Contact Group Lookup app and adds their preferred contact groups to the app.
 - They pin important contact groups to the top of the list by clicking the pin icon
 - The user then clicks the name of the contact group of interest
 -  The user sorts the list by status and starts a group chat with members who are online.

The following images show examples of the user interface of the app:
